# DeepSearch - A Hard Working Search Engine üîç

DeepSearch trains a small language model to develop effective search behaviors instead of memorizing static data. It interacts with multiple synthetic search engines, each with unique retrieval mechanisms, to refine queries and persist in searching until it finds exact answers. The project focuses on reinforcement learning, preventing overfitting, and optimizing for efficiency in real-world search applications.

## Personal Notes

- **This is research code**, so I'm prioritizing speed over code quality for now. Expect things to be messy‚Äîboth the code and commit history. Roasting is welcome, but don't judge me too hard; I'll clean it up later. **I don‚Äôt know what I don‚Äôt know**, but I‚Äôm eager (and desperate) to learn and improve, so any constructive feedback is highly appreciated! üíñ
